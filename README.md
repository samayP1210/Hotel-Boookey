# Hotel Boookey

Hotel Boookey is a high-tech hotel booking web app combining React.js and Firebase. React.js crafts a responsive frontend with reusable components, delivering an intuitive user interface. Firebase handles the backend, Firebase Authentication for security, and real-time synchronization for instant updates. Security is enforced through Firebase Security Rules, while Firebase Hosting ensures efficient deployment. An admin dashboard, built with React, streamlines hotel management. Together, React.js and Firebase create a secure, real-time, and user-centric hotel booking experience for both travelers and hotel owners.
